Thesis for my undergraduate degree in Physics at the University of Padua.

## Abstract

I will briefly recall the fundamentals of general relativity and relativistic fluid dynamics,
and apply those principles to the study of the luminosity of a black hole
undergoing spherically symmetrical accretion of a plasma of ionized hydrogen.

## Technicalities

This repository will be kept syncronyzed with the corresponding Overleaf page.
The thesis can be rendered by compiling the file `main.tex`.
