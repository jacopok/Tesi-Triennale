One formalism applies to systems with no special symmetries; its moments of the photon direction distribution are ‘projected, symmetric trace-free tensors’ ℳα1 α2 …αk. The other formalism applies to systems with spherical, planar or pseudospherical symmetry; its moments are scalar functions analogous to the J, H and K of non-relativistic theory. Both formalisms come in three variants: a frequency-dependent variant (moments are functions of frequency ν and of location in spacetime xα); a redshifted variant applicable only to spacetimes with a ‘universal redshift function’ R(xα) (moments are functions of redshifted frequency f = Rv and of xα); and a frequency-integrated variant (moments are functions of xα only).The moment formalisms’ emission, absorption and scattering terms are evaluated explicitly for an unmagnetized, fully ionized medium whose electrons are non-degenerate and non-relativistic and are in thermal equilibrium with each other. It is shown that double Compton scattering (one photon in and two out) followed by Comptonization of the new photon (‘DC+C’)can be a far more effective source of photon energy than bremsstrahlung in hot, dilute plasmas [at \\$T/10^7 \\text K\\gt(\\rho\_0/10^\\{-8\\}\\text g\\enspace\\text \\{cm\\}^\\{-3\\})^\\{2/11\\}\\$]. It is shown, further, that when the medium is sufficiently optically thick to Comptonization, DC + C can be described by a negative opacity (equation 6.43).}",

We analyse the integral curves of the differential equations describing the problem. We find a one-parameter family of critical points, where the inflow velocity equals the isothermal sound speed. Physical solutions must pass through one of these critical points. We obtain a complete set of boundary conditions which the solution must satisfy at the horizon of the black hole, and show that these, plus the requirement that the solution pass through a critical point, determine a unique solution to the problem. This analysis leads to a generalization of the well-known Bondi critical point constraint, which arises in the adiabatic accretion problem and which is effective at the point where the inflow velocity equals the adiabatic sound speed. We show that this point can be regarded as a ‘diffused critical point’ in our problem. The analysis also yields a simple expression for the diffusive luminosity at radial infinity. Finally, we find a satisfying explanation for the rather peculiar critical point structure of this problem in an analysis of the characteristics and subcharacteristics present in the problem and in a ‘hierarchical’ analysis of the waves which propagate along them.}",

	abstract = {Cooling and heating functions of cosmic gas are crucial ingredients for any study of gas dynamics and thermodynamics in the interstellar and intergalactic media. As such, they have been studied extensively in the past under the assumption of collisional ionization equilibrium. However, for a wide range of applications, the local radiation field introduces a non-negligible, often dominant, modification to the cooling and heating functions. In the most general case, these modifications cannot be described in simple terms and would require a detailed calculation with a large set of chemical species using a radiative transfer code (the well-known code Cloudy, for example). We show, however, that for a sufficiently general variation in the spectral shape and intensity of the incident radiation field, the cooling and heating functions can be approximated as depending only on several photoionization rates, which can be thought of as representative samples of the overall radiation field. This dependence is easy to tabulate and implement in cosmological or galactic-scale simulations, thus economically accounting for an important but rarely included factor in the evolution of cosmic gas. We also show a few examples where the radiation environment has a large effect, the most spectacular of which is a quasar that suppresses gas cooling in its host halo without any mechanical or non-radiative thermal feedback.}
