In non-radial motion around a Schwarzschild black hole the efficiency can be as high as \(e \sim \num{5.7e-2}\) \cite[eq. 2.8.5]{Nobili:2000}, which is several orders of magnitude more than that of spherical accretion in the models considered here.

This shows that, in general, spherical accretion has a very low luminosity.
