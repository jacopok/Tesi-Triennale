\subsection{Minkowski spacetime}

how we describe events in special relativity

\subsection{Differential geometry and tensor calculus}

The mathematical framework of differential geometry: coordinate systems, comoving tetrads (viewed through a fluid-dynamics point of view: introducing the velocity field of a fluid)

Covariant differentiation, parallel transport, Fermi-Walker transport

\subsection{General relativity}

Curvature: the Riemann tensor, the Einstein field equations, their resolution in the spherically symmetric case: the Schwarzschild metric, the approximations we will make (the fluid not being self-gravitating)
