> Minkowski spacetime: how we describe events in special relativity
> The mathematical framework of differential geometry: coordinate systems, comoving tetrads (viewed through a fluid-dynamics point of view: introducing the velocity field of a fluid)
> Covariant differentiation, parallel transport, Fermi-Walker transport
> Curvature: the Riemann tensor, the Einstein field equations, their resolution in the spherically symmetric case: the Schwarzschild metric, the approximations we will make (the fluid not being self-gravitating)
