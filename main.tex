\begin{abstract}
% After reviewing the basic concepts of general-relativistic fluid mechanics, I will focus on the treatment of non-ideal
% (viscous, thermo-conducting) flows. An application of non-ideal relativistic flows to spherical accretion onto black holes
% (generalized Bondi accretion) will be also discussed.
The problem of stationary, spherically symmetric accretion onto a Schwarzschild black hole is discussed here with the use of a formalism which is completely consistent with Einstein's General theory of Relativity.

The transfer of heat is a significant part of this process, however treating it without approximations has proven difficult.
First, we explore the adiabatic case; then we consider a more general case by assuming that all the heat tranfer happens through electromagnetic radiation.
For the latter we apply a formalism which, roughly speaking, while still being relativistic allows for the decomposition of the radiation into its first moments: energy density and flux.

The numerical analysis of the differential equations the problem can be reduced to shows a bimodal behaviour: a branch of solutions has a much higher efficiency (ratio of luminosity to accretion rate) than another.

In order to treat this problem, first the formalism of general relativity is briefly recalled; then we treat the basics of the relativistic formulation of the fluid dynamical equations, including the relativistic version of the Second Principle of thermodynamics.
